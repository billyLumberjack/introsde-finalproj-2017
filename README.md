# introsde-finalproj-2017
Final project for the course of introduction to service design and engineering.

## General Description
I implemented a modular web service application where each user can save data about her diet or physical activity. Furthermore It's possibile to find useful information about foods, exercises and statistics.

I wanted to keep the data structures as elastic as possible in order to leave the user free to save the info he's interested in.
